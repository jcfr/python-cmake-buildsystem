# Rules

# This rule is here for OPENSTEP/Rhapsody/MacOSX. It builds a temporary
# minimal framework (not including the Lib directory and such) in the current
# directory.

# Install the library

# Install the library and miscellaneous stuff needed for extending/embedding
# This goes into $(exec_prefix)
